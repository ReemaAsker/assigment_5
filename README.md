Assignment 5: OOP in Dart

Question
Write a Dart program that manages information for students using object-oriented
programming principles. Your task is to create a Student class that stores both required and
optional student data, and to demonstrate how to work with these objects in a list.

OOP Concepts to Demonstrate
- Constructor with required and optional properties
- Getters and setters
- Default values for properties
- Saving objects in a list
- Searching for students by grade
- Updating optional properties after creation

Instructions
1. Define a class named Student with the following properties:
- name (String, required in constructor)
- grade (double, required in constructor)
- email (String, optional, can be set later)
- address (String, optional, can be set later)
- phone (String, optional, can be set later)
2. Create a constructor for Student that requires only name and grade upon initialization.
3. Implement getters and setters for all properties.
- The setter for grade must validate that the value is between 0 and 100.
4. Create a list to store multiple student objects.
5. Add at least three students to the list, setting only the required fields at creation.
6. Use setters to update at least two optional properties (email, address, or phone) for each
student after they are added to the list.
7. Write a function that searches for all students whose grades are either greater than or
less than a specific value. (The function should accept the list, a grade value, and a boolean
to specify greater/less.)
8. Demonstrate usage by:
- Printing all students with their full information
- Showing the search results for students with grades greater than a specific value
- Updating an optional property for at least one student after creation and displaying the
updated student

What to Submit
- The complete Dart code for your solution.
- The output showing:
- The list of all students and their properties.
- The search results for the specified grade condition.
- The updated information after changing an optional property.
Add a toString() method to the Student class to make printing student info easier.

Addtional Questions :
1. Add a toString() method to the Student class to make printing student info easier.
2. Modify your program to allow sorting the list of students by grade in descending
order. Print the sorted list.
3. Add an id property (integer) to each student, and ensure that each student has a
unique ID assigned automatically when they are created.
4. Write a method in the Student class called isPassed() that returns true if the
student's grade is 60 or above, and false otherwise. Use this method to print the
names of all students who passed.
